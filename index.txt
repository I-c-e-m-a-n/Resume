About me

Results-oriented Computer Science graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence concentration) from the University of Delaware, with additional graduate-level research experience in Human-Computer Interaction, where I helped design AI-driven tools to aid children with autism. My academic background includes coursework in machine learning, quantum computing, parallel computing, data structures, and rapid prototyping, providing me with a strong technical foundation across AI, data science, and emerging technologies. Certified in Ethical Hacking (CEH) and having completed specialized programs in AI, blockchain, and IoT from MIT Sloan, I bring both breadth and depth in applying advanced technologies to real-world problems.

Complementing my academic foundation are two years of operational leadership through National Service in the Singapore Armed Forces, where I led a team of 30 operators, managed large-scale training and scheduling, and architected the unit’s first digital transformation platform that reduced manpower requirements by ~80%. I also built automation tools that saved ~60 hours of manual reporting each month and was recognized with the 23SA Regimental Sergeant Major Coin and the Safety Steward Award for my contributions. My earlier cybersecurity internships with the Maharashtra Cyber Police and Ernst & Young exposed me to OSINT investigations, anomaly detection, penetration testing, and risk modeling, sharpening my ability to identify patterns and deliver actionable intelligence. Together, these experiences demonstrate a proven ability to integrate technical expertise with leadership, innovation, and operational execution across defense, academia, and cybersecurity domains.

## certifications

Certifications

alt = AI : Implications for Business Strategy
AI : Implications for Business Strategy
Focusing on key AI technologies, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, the course will helps understand the implications of these new technologies for business strategy, as well as the economic and societal issues they raise. MIT expert instructors examine how artificial intelligence will complement and strengthen the workforce rather than just eliminate jobs. Additionally, the program will emphasize how the collective intelligence of people and computers together can solve business problems that not long ago were considered impossible.

alt = Certified Ethical Hacker
Certified Ethical Hacker
Having an understanding of system weaknesses and vulnerabilities, the CEH course helps students learn to protect their organizations and strengthen their security controls in order to minimize the risk of a malicious attack.

alt = Blockchain Technologies: Business innovation and Application
Blockchain Technologies: Business innovation and Application
Blockchain Technologies: Business Innovation and Application explores parallels between blockchain technology and other general purpose technologies, highlighting its capacity to enable widespread, transformational change. It examines how blockchain technology can cheaply verify, under certain conditions, the attributes of a transaction. Students gain a deeper understanding of the cost of networking, and learn how blockchain technology can bootstrap and facilitate a marketplace without traditional intermediaries. Using an engaging mix of resources, students are guided to explore the effects of blockchain technology on market power in digital platforms, privacy, and trust.

alt = Internet of things: Business Implications and Opportunities
Internet of things: Business Implications and Opportunities
The program aims to help students envision and lead IoT-based transformations, not just understand the technical elements. The goal is to demystify IoT jargon so that managers can start to achieve the strategic advantage IoT makes possible. The course will provide participants with an introduction to the necessary technologies, skill components, and enablers and constraints for using IoT in a business. It provides many examples where IoT is already transforming customer experience, operations and business models. It also explains the four key elements of leadership capability that make transformation possible through IoT. Real-world case studies, senior executive interviews, self-assessments, and practical assignments will guide participants as they construct a personal roadmap to gain strategic advantage from IoT.

alt = Machine Learning
Machine Learning
The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. This beginner-friendly program teaches students the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing. AI to advance the AI field.This 3-course Specialization is an updated version of Andrew’s pioneering Machine Learning course, rated 4.9 out of 5 and taken by over 4.8 million learners since it launched in 2012. It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.) By the end of this Specialization, students will have mastered key concepts and gained the practical know-how to quickly and powerfully apply machine learning to challenging real-world problems.
